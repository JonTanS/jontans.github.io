title: Prove the $ \sqrt{2} $ is Irrational

    This is one of the classic proofs by contradiction. The general flow of using this technique
    is to first assume the opposite and then sort of play around and go down a path that will eventually
    show that this is not true.

    <h1>Prove that the $ \sqrt{2} $ is Irrational</h1>
    <p>
        We start off with assuming the opposite: Suppose $ \sqrt{2} $ is rational.

        This means that we can rewrite this as the ratio of two integers <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> such that:
        $$ \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} $$

        and by definition of a rational number, <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> will have no common factors.
        Now we square both sides and get:
        
        $$ 2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} $$

        Multiplying both sides by $ b^2 $, we have:
        $$ 2b^2 = a^2 $$

        At this point, we now need to show that both sides have common factors to find the contradition.
        Observing the equation, we know that <strong>a</strong> has to be even. Why? We look at the left hand side.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 is an even number</li>
        <li>$ b^2 $ can either be odd or even</li>
        <li>An even number times any number comes out to be even!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus $ a^2 $ is even and that means <strong>a</strong> is also even. 

        <br>
        Now we can introduce a variable <strong>k</strong> to replace <strong>a</strong> and multiply it by
        2 to keep the even property of <strong>a</strong>.

        $$ 2b^2 = (2k)^2 $$

        Further evaluating we have:

        $$ 2b^2 = 4k^2 $$

        $$ b^2 = 2k^2 $$

        Look at that, we have now shown that $ b^2 $ is even and thus <strong>b</strong> is even.

        We know that <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are even, so they have to at least share the common factor 2, but this contradicts
        the factual statement above where they can't share any common factors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This means that $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be rational and is in fact irrational.
