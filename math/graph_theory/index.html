        Welcome to the Graph Theory Section. This place is about looking at
        anything graph related!

        What are Graphs?
    </h3>
    <p>        
        A <strong>graph</strong> is made up of two finite sets V and E. 
        
        Each element found in set V is a called a vertex (vertices in plural).
        
        Each element found in set E is an edge and each edge is an unordered pair of vertices.
        
        <br> <br>

        For example, we may have a set <strong>V</strong> defined as:
        $$ \{a,b,c,d,e,f\} $$ 
        and a set <strong>E</strong> defined as:

        $$\{\{a,b\}, \{a,d\}, \{b,d\}, \{b,e\}, \{b,f\}, \{c,d\}, \{c,f\}, \{e,f\}\}$$
    
        The resulting graph would then be represented as:
