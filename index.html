                Welcome to Jonathan Tan's Notes! These pages are meant to document 
                some cool items that interest me. Read about me 
                <a href="/about">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            Otherwise here are a few topics that I will be documenting.
            I've put them into sections     

            <h1>Contents</h1>
            <h2><a href="/math">Math</a></h2>
            

            <p></p>
