    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Jonathan Tan. I am currently a software engineer at Google
        in the Global Networks Team.
        I enjoy various things such as running, building mechanical keyboards, and 
        learning about different cultures.

        With programming, I'm interested in Distributed Systems and Machine Learning
        and have worked with creating Microservices Pipelines for ETL workloads on
        Cisco's Enterprise Data. 
        
        In my repository, I hope to document some of the cool interesting things I
        am learning and also hope it helps people understand some of the topics deeper!

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Amazon AWS AI - Deep Learning Engineer</h2>

        My time at Amazon AI involved working on the Deep Learning framework MXNet and Deep Java Library. We 
        built new features and improved performance of various models such as Bert, Resnet, Machine Translation.
        
        <br><br>
        <tab>
            <strong>MXNet Benchmarking</strong> - Created a benchmarking system to test commonly used 
            ML Models run against the master branch of MXNet. This system was built on AWS with S3, EC2,
            Cloudwatch, Lambda. Through this system, we were able to find bugs and to benchmark upcoming
            features to ensure the highest quality of code.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Large Tensor Support</strong> - Helped developed Large Tensor, a 64 bit version of MXNet.
            Various operators showed regression when testing this such as the broadcast all ops.
        </tab>

        <br><br>
        <tab>
            <strong>MultiEngine Support</strong> - Implemented a DJL feature that allows the user to switch
            between MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch. or any new deep learning framework
            for their model inference or training. 
        </tab>
        <br><br>
        <tab>
            <strong>Blogposts/Tutorials</strong> - Wrote various blogposts covering how to load models
            into DJL and performce inference and cost comparisons against different hosting 
            techniques (AWS BeanStalk, EC2, Lambda, Model saved in S3).
        </tab>

        <h2>Cisco Data Enterprise Services - Software/Data Engineer</h2>

        My time at Cisco involved working mainly on their Data & Analytics Team where they
        need to ingest customer bookings data from all of Cisco's acquisitions to report to 
        Wall Street and to give insights to business analysts to better sell Cisco's products.

        <br><br>

        <tab>
            <strong>Acquisition Data Ingestion Platform</strong> - Created an end to end service for Cisco's 
            acquisitions to submit the bookings for the week. This included working with the business 
            to understand different bookings flows (upsell/downsell), further downstream business 
            systems, and data modeling and design to keep the system scalable for future 
            acquisitions. This system was built using Java Spring, Openshift, RabbitMQ, 
            Docker, HBase/MongoDB.
            <br><br>
            <strong>TAC Analytics</strong> - Created buckets and ML pipeline to help TAC engineers 
            figure out and triage RMA requests. This reduced the number of needed RMAs by issuing software 
            updates.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Snowflake Accounts Integration</strong> - Created a platform for engineers to login
            to a Snowflake account and integrated it with Cisco systems. Helped optimize existing ETL
            pipelines. This was done by creating APIs with Python Flask and connecting to Snowflake 
            Databases and Cisco's internal databases.
